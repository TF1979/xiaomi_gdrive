  Example: telnet 192.168.0.70
  ```

6. Go to the browser
7. Create your Google Drive application and OAuth keys for Google Drive API (example tutorial: http://www.iperiusbackup.net/en/how-to-enable-google-drive-api-and-get-client-credentials/)
Example:
  1. Go to Google Api Console (https://console.developers.google.com/?hl=RU)
  2. Click "Drive API"
  3. Click "Enable"
  4. Create project
  5. Click "Create credentials" and choose OAuth client ID
  6. Choose application type: Other types 
  7. Save your client id and client secret
8. Go to your console back
9. Run GDriveConf to configure your Google Drive access:

  ```
  sh /home/hd1/gdrive/GDriveConf
  ```

10. Paste your client id and press enter
11. Paste your client secret and press enter
12. Copy link which you see and paste into your browser
13. Click "Accept"
14. Copy code which you see
15. Go to your console back
16. Paste your code and press enter
17. You will be suggested to see the folders. Press Enter if you want to see all folders. If you want to see only root folders type `root` and press Enter.
//Folders showing isn't fast. Wait for 5-10 seconds to see your directories.
18. You will see your folders (number of folder is on the left side)
19. Type the number of a folder and press Enter. (If you want to save videos in the root dir then just press Enter)
20. You will be asked if you want to turn on automatic remove. Press `1` and type Enter if you want. Press `0` and type Enter if you do not want. GDriveAutoremover itself will delete old files in case if your disk space overflows.
21. Reboot your camera:

  ```
  reboot
  ```

22. Done

How it works:
The script in the loop will create the same folders as in the record folder and upload videos into Google Drive. After the reboot, or failure of the Internet script continues normally send files. If you have enabled automatic remove, GDriveAutoremover will check your free space every 45 minutes. In case when disk space is not enough, the script will erase old videos (IMPORTANT: do not put anything extra in the folder which is designed for video because GDriveAutoremover can remove it if it considers that the disk space is not enough).

This scripts were tested under 1.8.5.1L firmware

Troubleshooting:

1. Your camera starts reboot from time to time. Your RAM is likely not enough. Turn off additional features which you have installed.
  1. Turn off ftp server:
  
    ```
    rm /etc/init.d/S89ftp
    ```
  
  2. Turn off HTTP server
    ```
    rm /home/web/server
    rm /home/web/record
    ```
  
  3. Turn off RTSP server
  
    ```
    rm /home/rtspsvr
    mv /home/recv_X.726 /home/recv.726
    ```
  
  4. Reboot your camera
  
    ```
    reboot
    ```

2. Check if camera can send requests to the Internet.
  
  ```
  ping -q -c2 8.8.8.8
  ping -q -c2 google.com
  ```

  if it isn't pingable then check your route table:

  ```
  route -n
  ```
  
  1. If your gateway isn't correct then add your gateway (Where 192.168.0.1 is your router IP address):
  
    ```
    my_router_ip="192.168.0.1"
    route add default gw ${my_router_ip} ra0
    ```
  
  2. Add execution of this command after reboot:
  
    ```
    echo "#!/bin/sh" > /etc/init.d/S65route
    echo "change_def_route(){" >> /etc/init.d/S65route
    echo "route add default gw ${my_router_ip} ra0" >> /etc/init.d/S65route
    echo "}" >> /etc/init.d/S65route
    echo "change_def_route &" >> /etc/init.d/S65route
    echo "exit 0" >> /etc/init.d/S65route
    chmod +x vi /etc/init.d/S65route
    echo "${my_router_ip}" > /tmp/gw1
    ```
  
  3. Add public DNS
    
    ```
    echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /var/run/dhcpcd/resolv.conf/resolv.conf
    echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
    ```
  
  4. Reboot your camera
  
    ```
    reboot
    ```
